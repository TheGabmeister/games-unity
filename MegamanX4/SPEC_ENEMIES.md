# SPEC_ENEMIES

## Context

Covers every regular (non-boss, non-sub-boss) enemy in Mega Man X4, across the intro stage (Sky Lagoon) and the eight Maverick stages. Goal: one spec covering all 40 enemies so component reuse, stat balance, and generator scope can be planned end-to-end rather than stage-by-stage.

Phase 1 (Sky Lagoon, 7 enemies) is already implemented. This spec treats those as reference entries — behavior is frozen, stats scaled to the new HP/damage range (player HP 100, default enemy HP 10).

**Scope exclusions:** all bosses (Eregion, Web Spider, Cyber Peacock, Storm Owl, Magma Dragoon, Jet Stingray, Slash Beast, Frost Walrus, Split Mushroom) and all sub-bosses (Generaid Core, DG-42L, Eyezard, Tentoroid). These are set-piece encounters and don't share the component-composition pattern used for regular enemies.

**Deferred:** King Poseidon (needs a water system that doesn't exist yet). Metal Gabyoall's full wall/ceiling crawl (shipped as floor-only `PatrolWalk` for now; revisit later if stage layout demands surface crawling). Raiden — an AI-piloted Ride Armor (same chassis as the player-controlled Ride Armor) — depends on the Ride Armor subsystem, so it ships alongside that work, not in the regular enemy roster.

## Stat scale reference

Player X has 100 HP. Buster: tap ~5 dmg, semi-charge ~15, full-charge ~30. Special weapons scale up to ~40.

| Tier | HP | Typical contact | Typical shot |
|------|----|-----------------|--------------|
| Chaff (1-shot) | 5–10 | 5–10 | — |
| Grunt (2–3 shots) | 15–25 | 10–15 | 5–10 |
| Heavy (4–6 shots) | 30–50 | 15–25 | 10–20 |
| Tank (8+ shots) | 60–120 | 25–40 | 15–30 |
| Invulnerable | ∞ | 20–30 | 10–25 |

## Existing infrastructure

18 components ship today, grouped by folder.

**Enemy** ([Assets/_Project/Scripts/Enemy/](Assets/_Project/Scripts/Enemy/))

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `DestroyOnDepleted` | Lifecycle: subscribes to `Health.Depleted` → destroys GameObject (reusable across enemies + destructibles) |
| `PlayerDetector` | Range-based player detection (radial `OverlapCircle`) with optional LoS raycast; fires `PlayerDetected`/`PlayerLost`; exposes `CanSeePlayer`, `PlayerPosition` |
| `PatrolWalk` | Walk at `_speed`, flip on wall/ledge raycast, pausable, flips root `localScale.x` to face |
| `EnemyShoot` | Polls `CanSeePlayer`, aims muzzle, fires burst with cooldown; pauses sibling `PatrolWalk` during burst |
| `AutoShoot` | Fire-and-forget: spawn projectile at `_interval`, no detection, muzzle direction is the shot direction |
| `SwoopAttack` | State machine Idle/Diving/Returning/Cooldown; dives to captured player position, returns, resumes `HoverSine` |
| `DropTrigger` | Overlap-below detection; on trigger: enable Dynamic RB + gravity, enable paired HurtBox |
| `DestroyOnWallContact` | `OnCollisionEnter2D`/`OnTriggerEnter2D` with Environment → Destroy |

**Behavior** ([Assets/_Project/Scripts/Behavior/](Assets/_Project/Scripts/Behavior/))

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `MoveForward` | Translate along `transform.right` at fixed speed |
| `MoveVertical` | Translate along ±`transform.up` at fixed speed |
| `HoverSine` | Sine-wave Y oscillation around a recorded center; pausable; `SetCenter(y)` for dive-return reset |
| `Gravity` | Kinematic downward pull with ground raycast + max fall speed clamp |
| `Lifetime` | Auto-destroy timer |

**Damage** ([Assets/_Project/Scripts/Damage/](Assets/_Project/Scripts/Damage/))

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `Health` | HP pool, i-frames, `Damaged`/`Depleted`/`HealthChanged`/`InvulnerabilityChanged` events |
| `HitBox` | On contact (trigger or collision) calls `HurtBox.ReceiveHit` with `_damage` |
| `HurtBox` | Routes hits to parent `Health.ApplyDamage` |
| `InvulnerabilityBlinker` | Blinks `SpriteRenderer.enabled` during i-frames (player-style hit gating) |
| `DamageFlash` | On `Health.Damaged`, briefly sets `SpriteRenderer.color` to white; restores on timeout |

Layers (see [Layers.cs](Assets/_Project/Scripts/Layers.cs)): `Player`, `Environment`, `Enemy`, `Ladder`, `PlayerProjectile`, `PlayerProjectileNoClip`, `EnemyProjectile`. Physics2D matrix already routes `EnemyProjectile ↔ Player, Environment` and `PlayerProjectile ↔ Enemy, Environment`.

**Conventions** (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)): SVGs authored facing right, either natively or via flip-wrapper for grandfathered assets; all rotations flow from the root/muzzle `transform`, never from `localScale.x` flips for direction math; gravity is custom for AI-driven enemies (via `Gravity`), physics-driven only for pure hazards (Spike Marl post-drop). Standard enemy composition core: `DestroyOnDepleted` + `Health` + `HurtBox` + `HitBox` + `DamageFlash` — shorthand `(core)` below.

## Enemy roster — Recurring

Enemies that appear in multiple stages. Listed first because they form the backbone of the bestiary.

### 1. Knot Beret B (blue soldier) *(Sky Lagoon, Military Train)*

**Behavior:** Most common enemy. Walks along platforms on patrol. When the player enters range, stops, faces the player, and fires a 3-round burst. Resumes patrol after. Falls off ledges if not edge-guarded.

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| HP | 15 |
| Contact damage | 10 |
| Shot damage | 8 |
| Detection range | ~8 units |
| Patrol speed | ~2 u/s |

**Composition:** (core) + `Gravity` + `PatrolWalk` + `PlayerDetector` + `EnemyShoot` (burst=3).

### 2. Knot Beret G (green soldier) *(Sky Lagoon, Military Train)*

**Behavior:** Stationary variant. Stands in place, faces the player when detected, fires a single aimed shot on cooldown.

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| HP | 15 |
| Contact damage | 10 |
| Shot damage | 10 |
| Detection range | ~10 units |

**Composition:** (core) + `Gravity` + `PlayerDetector` + `EnemyShoot` (burst=1, longer cooldown).

### 3. Spike Marl (ceiling mine) *(Sky Lagoon, Cyber Space)*

**Behavior:** Ceiling-attached spiked ball. Inert until player passes below, then detaches and drops straight down. High contact damage. Destroyed on ground impact.

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| HP (post-drop) | 10 |
| Contact damage | 30 |
| Trigger range below | ~2 units × 20 |

**Composition:** `DestroyOnDepleted` + `Health` + `HurtBox` (disabled until drop) + `HitBox` + `DamageFlash` + `DropTrigger`. Post-drop: `Rigidbody2D` switches to Dynamic, `gravityScale = 3`.

### 4. Kyunnbyunn (swooping bird) *(Sky Lagoon, Jungle)*

**Behavior:** Flies horizontally in a sine-wave pattern across the screen. Does not turn — flies once and despawns. Often spawns in groups of 2–3.

|------|-------|
| HP | 10 |
| Contact damage | 10 |
| Shot damage | 8 |
| Fire interval | ~2.5 s |

**Composition:** (core) + `HoverSine` (low amplitude) + `BlastRaster.cs` *(single-use — periodic 4- or 8-way radial fire from a private `FireRadial(n)` method)*.

| Contact damage | 25 |
| Shot damage | 20 |
| Fire interval | ~3 s |

**Composition:** (core) + `MoveVertical` (slow down) + `TrackPlayer` (X-axis, slow) + `AutoShoot` (fixed downward muzzle — the drift makes shots feel aimed without actual aim logic).

### 8. Plasma Cannon *(Air Force, Military Train)*

**Behavior:** Wall-mounted cannon. Charges a plasma beam with visible telegraph, then fires a sustained beam across the screen for ~1 s. Invulnerable.

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| HP | ∞ |
| Contact damage | — |
| Beam damage | 20 (per tick) |
| Cycle | ~3 s |

**Composition:** `HitBox` + `PlasmaCannon.cs` *(single-use — charge/fire/cooldown state machine; beam is a stretched SVG with a toggled `BoxCollider2D` child that activates during the active window)*. No `DestroyOnDepleted`/`Health`.

### 9. Batton Bone B81 *(Volcano, Military Train, Bio Laboratory)*

**Behavior:** Classic bat. Hangs upside-down on ceiling, inert. When the player approaches, activates: drops briefly, then flies in a zigzag sine path toward the player. Does not return.

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| HP | 10 |
| Contact damage | 15 |
| Detection range | ~6 units |
| Fly speed | ~4 u/s |

**Composition:** (core) + `PlayerDetector` + `BattonBone.cs` *(single-use — sleep → drop → fly. Directly drives position, can delegate to `MoveForward`+`HoverSine` after activation if clean.)*.

### 10. Mettaur D2 *(Volcano, Military Train, Snow Base)*

**Behavior:** Hides under armored hat (invulnerable). Peeks out on cooldown, fires a 3-way spread (down-left, down, down-right), returns to hiding. Small and slow.

| HP (peeking) | 10 |
| Contact damage | 10 |
| Shot damage | 8 |
| Hide/peek cycle | ~2 s |

**Composition:** (core) + `Mettaur.cs` *(single-use — hide/peek state machine, toggles sibling `HurtBox.enabled`, plus a private `FireSpread(3)` method for the 3-way shot)*.

### 11. Spiky Mk-II *(Volcano, Bio Laboratory)*

**Behavior:** Spiked ball. Rolls along the floor in a patrol pattern. Spike-covered body = contact damage; usually placed in narrow corridors.

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|

| Contact damage | 20 |
| Roll speed | ~3 u/s |

**Composition:** (core) + `Gravity` + `PatrolWalk`.

### 12. Raiden *(Volcano, Military Train)* — **DEFERRED**

An AI-piloted **Ride Armor** (same chassis as the player-controlled Ride Armor the player can board in Volcano and Military Train — saber combos, charged lance thrust, walk/jump locomotion, tanky HP). Behavior = "pilot the mech at the player" rather than a dedicated enemy script. Depends on the Ride Armor subsystem existing. Revisit after the player-side Ride Armor lands; an `AIRidePilot` script then drives the existing chassis. Not part of the regular enemy roster.

---

## New reusable components *(1 item)*

Genuinely shared behavior used by 3+ enemies. Lives in [Assets/_Project/Scripts/Enemy/](Assets/_Project/Scripts/Enemy/) (or `Behavior/` for non-enemy-specific items).

| Component | Used by | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `TrackPlayer` | Hover Gunner, Giga Death, Dejira, Fly Gunner | Match player's X (or Y) with speed cap; axis + max speed configurable. Finds the player via `Physics2D.OverlapCircle` on the Player layer (same pattern as `PlayerDetector`). |

**Deferred as components:** `SpreadShoot` (1 user: Mettaur) and `RadialShoot` (2 users: Blast Raster, TriScan) start as private methods inside their AI scripts. If a third caller ever appears with the same shape, extract then.

## New single-use enemy AI scripts *(14 items)*

One script per enemy, encapsulating its signature choreography as a small state machine or behavior. Each is ~30–80 lines, composes existing infrastructure for shared parts (`Health`, `HurtBox`, `HitBox`, `DamageFlash`, `PlayerDetector`, etc.), and reads as a single file you can navigate top-to-bottom.

Lives in **[Assets/_Project/Scripts/Enemy/AI/](Assets/_Project/Scripts/Enemy/AI/)** (new folder) so reusable components in `Enemy/` stay easy to find.

| Script | Enemy | What it does |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| `Mettaur.cs` | Mettaur D2 | Hide/peek/fire state machine; toggles sibling `HurtBox.enabled`; private `FireSpread(3)` method for the 3-way shot |
| `BattonBone.cs` | Batton Bone B81 | Sleep on ceiling → drop briefly → fly in sine-wave toward player |
| `BlastRaster.cs` | Blast Raster | Periodic radial fire via private `FireRadial(n)` (4 or 8 directions) |
| `MegaNest.cs` | Mega Nest | Periodic spawn with active-count cap (tracks children via `OnDestroy` callback) |
| `Yukidarubon.cs` | Yukidarubon | On `Health.Depleted`, instantiates N child prefabs before destroy |
| `Togerics.cs` | Togerics | Leap-toward-player with arc, cooldown on land |
| `Protecton.cs` | Protecton | Front-angle hit filter via `Health.Damaged` source position vs. facing — toggles `HurtBox.enabled` per-hit |
| `Obiiru.cs` | Obiiru | Pendulum swing around anchor point *(uncertain behavior — verify)* |
| `TriScan.cs` | TriScan | Rotating 3-way beam sweep via private `FireRadial(3)` |
| `MiruToraeru.cs` | Miru Toraeru | Teleport + attack cycle *(uncertain behavior — verify)* |
| `KillFisher.cs` | Kill Fisher | Hook dangle/retract cycle + child `HitBox` on the hook |
| `Prominence.cs` | Prominence | Active/inactive hazard cycle (toggles sprite + collider on timer) |
| `PlasmaCannon.cs` | Plasma Cannon | Charge telegraph → sustained beam for duration → cooldown; beam is a stretched SVG + toggled `BoxCollider2D` |
| `BeamCannon.cs` | Beam Cannon | Wider/longer sustained beam; same stretched-SVG + toggled-collider approach |

**Beam architecture note:** The two beam enemies (`PlasmaCannon`, `BeamCannon`) each ship as their own script first. Once both have concrete implementations, inspect for shared shape and extract a `BeamProjectile` helper only if the extraction is clean. Don't design the shared helper upfront; let it emerge (or not) from the two concrete cases.

---

## Component revisions

Minor, additive changes to existing components. No breaking changes.

- **`PlayerDetector`** — Add optional `_coneAngle` (0 = radial, >0 = directional cone in facing direction) so patrolling shooters stop detecting the player behind them. Default 0 preserves current behavior.
- **`SwoopAttack`** — Add optional `_returnTarget` (Transform or Vector2 override) so Spider Core can anchor return to a fixed ceiling point rather than its spawn position. Default preserves current behavior (return to spawn).

That's it. The scope-heavy revisions from the earlier draft (`Gravity` direction field, `BeamProjectile` new type, `HurtBox` angle filter, `DropTrigger` retirement) all get dropped because the work they enabled moved into single-use scripts that don't need base-component changes.

---

## Scalability review

The 18-component base + 1 new reusable component + 14 single-use AI scripts scales cleanly to 40 enemies (minus Raiden, deferred to the Ride Armor subsystem). The key insight: **the composition-vs-single-use decision is itself a scalability lever**. Apply it consistently and the component library stays small, the enemy scripts stay readable, and effort estimates stop lying.

### 1. Rule of three for components

New code becomes a reusable component only when **3+ enemies genuinely need it**. Below that threshold: write a single-use enemy script that composes existing components, and put the shared-looking behavior behind a private method. This is why the new-component count is 1, not 3+ — only `TrackPlayer` clears the bar.

Why it matters: single-use components masquerading as reusable abstractions bloat the library, spread choreography logic across event-coupled files, and hide day-scale work in hours-scale table rows. A single-file `Mettaur.cs` is easier to understand, debug, and rewrite than `HideShell + SpreadShoot + glue` communicating via events. If a private `FireSpread`/`FireRadial` method shows up in three AI scripts with the same shape, *then* extract.

### 2. Folder separation

- [Assets/_Project/Scripts/Enemy/](Assets/_Project/Scripts/Enemy/) — reusable components (existing + `TrackPlayer`, `SpreadShoot`, `RadialShoot`).
- [Assets/_Project/Scripts/Enemy/AI/](Assets/_Project/Scripts/Enemy/AI/) — single-use AI scripts, one per enemy.

That separation makes it obvious what's reusable (don't gate-keep; encouraged) vs. what's enemy-specific (don't reach for when authoring a new enemy — start with components instead).

### 3. Generator split per stage

**Trigger:** When [SkyLagoonEnemyGenerator.cs](Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/SkyLagoonEnemyGenerator.cs) is touched to add a sixth enemy or we start Jungle — whichever comes first.

**Action:** Refactor into per-stage generator files + a shared core.

- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Editor/EnemyGeneratorCore.cs` — `NewEnemyRoot`, `AddMuzzle`, `SetField`, `LoadSprite`/`LoadPrefab`/`LoadMaterial`, `SavePrefab`, `AddGravity`. All current helpers move here.
- `SkyLagoonEnemyGenerator.cs`, `RecurringEnemyGenerator.cs`, `JungleEnemyGenerator.cs`, … — each registers its own `Tools/MegamanX4/Generate X Enemies` menu item.
- `AllEnemiesGenerator.cs` — a `Tools/MegamanX4/Generate All Enemies` meta-item that calls every generator.

### 4. Prefab variants for palette/stat tweaks

**Trigger:** Next time we generate a variant (Knot Beret S, Hornet, Metal Hawk, Fly Gunner, Walk Shooter, Guardian/Death Guardian, Tentoroid BS).

**Action:** Author the base enemy normally via the generator. For variants, use Unity's **Prefab Variant** feature — create from the base, override only the changed fields (sprite, tint, stats). Don't write a second generator method.

### 5. ScriptableObject-driven stats *(defer)*

**Trigger:** First time the user asks for a balance tuning pass across many enemies.

Not needed yet. 40 enemies × 5 stats = 200 values; still fine to edit in code during iteration. Add the abstraction when it starts hurting.

### 6. What doesn't need changing

- **Component composition model** — proven.
- **Physics matrix + layer routing** — no new layers needed.
- **Editor generator pattern** — `SerializedObject.FindProperty` + `PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefabAsset` scales to any number of prefabs.
- **`DestroyOnDepleted` lifecycle** — stays `Depleted → Destroy`.

## Phased implementation order

Stage-by-stage rollout. Each stage lists its net-new work; anything unlisted is already implemented or covered by an earlier phase.

### Phase 1 — Foundation ✅ *implemented*

Sky Lagoon (7 enemies). Components: `PlayerDetector`, `AutoShoot`, `DestroyOnWallContact`, `EnemyShoot`, `PatrolWalk`, `HoverSine`, `SwoopAttack`, `DropTrigger`, `Gravity`, `DamageFlash`, `InvulnerabilityBlinker`.

### Phase 2 — Recurring extension

Build before any Maverick stage so the bestiary backbone is solid.

- **Reusable components:** `TrackPlayer`.
- **AI scripts:** `Mettaur.cs`, `BattonBone.cs`, `BlastRaster.cs`, `PlasmaCannon.cs`.
- **Generator split refactor** (Scalability §3) happens before Phase 3.

Enemies shipped: Blast Raster, Hover Gunner, Giga Death, Plasma Cannon, Batton Bone B81, Mettaur D2, Spiky Mk-II. Raiden deferred (Ride Armor subsystem dependency).

### Phase 3 — Jungle

- **AI scripts:** `KillFisher.cs`, `MegaNest.cs`, `Obiiru.cs`.
- **Revisions:** `SwoopAttack` return-target override (for Spider Core).
- **Deferred:** King Poseidon (water system), Metal Gabyoall wall-crawl (ship floor-only).

Enemies shipped: Kill Fisher, Metal Gabyoall (simplified), Obiiru, Mega Nest, Spider Core.

### Phase 4 — Cyber Space

- **AI scripts:** `MiruToraeru.cs`, `TriScan.cs`, `Protecton.cs`.
- **Revisions:** `PlayerDetector` cone angle (for Protecton + any future directional shooter).

Enemies shipped: Miru Toraeru, TriScan, Protecton.

### Phase 5 — Air Force

- **AI scripts:** `BeamCannon.cs`. At this point both beam enemies (Plasma Cannon + Beam Cannon) exist — inspect for shared shape, extract `BeamProjectile` helper if clean.
- **Prefab variants:** Metal Hawk (from Tonboroid), Walk Shooter (from Knot Beret B).

Enemies shipped: Beam Cannon, Metal Hawk, Walk Shooter.

### Phase 6 — Volcano + Marine Base

- **AI scripts:** `Prominence.cs`.
- **Prefab variants:** Hornet (from Tonboroid).

Enemies shipped: Prominence, Hornet.

### Phase 7 — Snow Base

- **AI scripts:** `Yukidarubon.cs`.
- **Prefab variants:** Knot Beret S (from Knot Beret B), Fly Gunner (from Hover Gunner).

Enemies shipped: E-AT, Yukidarubon, Knot Beret S, Fly Gunner, Ice Wing.

### Phase 8 — Bio Laboratory

- **AI scripts:** `Togerics.cs`.
- **Prefab variants:** Tentoroid BS (from RS), Guardian (from Knot Beret G), Death Guardian (from Guardian).

Enemies shipped: Tentoroid RS, Tentoroid BS, Togerics, Dejira, Guardian, Death Guardian.

### Phase 9 — Polish

Per-enemy audio hooks, spawn volumes, stage-specific palettes, prefab variant cleanup, surface-crawl subsystem revisit (Metal Gabyoall), water system + King Poseidon.

## SVG assets needed

Existing SVGs (✅ already authored): Knot Beret B, G; Spike Marl; Kyunnbyunn; Tonboroid S; Mad Bull 97; Trap Blast.

New authored SVGs needed (31 — King Poseidon and Raiden deferred). Authored per-phase alongside their enemies, not upfront:

| Enemy | Dimensions | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Blast Raster | ~48×48 | Red floating orb, layered glow |
| Hover Gunner | ~48×40 | Helicopter drone, rotor on top |
| Giga Death | ~80×64 | Heavy armored turret, downward-facing cannon |
| Plasma Cannon | ~48×40 | Wall turret with charge socket |
| Batton Bone B81 | ~32×32 | Bat: wings-folded "hanging" pose; separate open-wing pose for flight (swap) |
| Mettaur D2 | ~32×32 | Classic dome with eyes |
| Spiky Mk-II | ~32×32 | Spiked ball, symmetric |
| Kill Fisher | ~32×40 + hook | Tree-hanging fisher + separate hook-line sprite |
| Metal Gabyoall | ~32×24 | Spiked slab, symmetric |
| Obiiru | ~32×48 | Swinging jungle creature |

| Prominence | ~32×64 | Fire pillar, tall |
| Hornet | ~40×32 | Wasp, horizontal |
| E-AT | ~48×48 | Frost mech, stocky |
| Yukidarubon | ~32×32 (+ small variant ~16×16) | Snowman; authored large + small for split |
| Knot Beret S | — | Prefab variant; reuse Knot Beret B SVG with palette swap |
| Fly Gunner | — | Prefab variant of Hover Gunner |
| Ice Wing | ~40×32 | Ice bird, wings spread |
| Tentoroid RS | ~40×40 | Red orb with red accents |
| Tentoroid BS | — | Prefab variant (blue palette) |
| Togerics | ~32×32 | Spiky bio-creature |
| Dejira | ~40×40 | Spike blob |
| Guardian | — | Prefab variant of Knot Beret G (lab palette) |
| Death Guardian | — | Prefab variant of Guardian |

**Authoring convention:** SVGs are authored facing right — same invariant as projectiles and the player. Positive X = forward = canonical render direction. Enemies that should face left in a scene are flipped at the prefab/scene level via `localScale.x = -1` (or `PatrolWalk._initialFacing = -1`), not by re-authoring the SVG. Existing left-authored enemies (Knot Beret B/G, Kyunnbyunn, Mad Bull 97, Tonboroid S, Trap Blast) use a flip-wrapper (`<g transform="translate(W 0) scale(-1 1)">`) to render right — preserved for GUID stability, but new SVGs should be drawn right directly.

## Verification

Per enemy, place in `Gameplay.unity` and confirm:

- Takes damage from player projectiles; `DamageFlash` white-flashes on every hit; destroyed at 0 HP (or never, for invulnerable hazards).
- Deals listed contact/shot damage; player knockback + i-frames trigger.
- Unique behavior matches description: patrol turns at edges; detection triggers attack; swoop dives + returns; mine drops; charger self-destructs on wall; turret/cannon fires on interval; bird follows wave pattern; beam telegraphs before firing; hide/peek cycle; spawner respects cap; on-destroy splits into children; directional shield blocks front hits only.
- Projectiles on `EnemyProjectile` layer; hit player, not other enemies.
- No NullReferenceExceptions when optional components are absent (graceful null checks).

Per stage, confirm in `Gameplay.unity`:

- Stage-specific enemies spawn/destroy on entry/exit of trigger volumes.
- Recurring enemies reused across stages share a single prefab reference (or variant chain), not copy-pasted.

Per refactor (Phase 2 generator split, Phase 5 prefab variants):

- Re-running `Tools/MegamanX4/Generate *` menu items produces identical prefabs to the pre-refactor versions (diff-check before/after).
